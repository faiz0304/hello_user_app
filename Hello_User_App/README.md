# Hello User App (Day 1 Mini Project)

This is my Day 1 Python Mini Project.  
The program collects user information (name, age, city, qualification, etc.), validates it, and then:

- Displays a formatted introduction in the terminal  
- Validates user input (age must be a positive integer)  
- Highlights important information with colored output (using `colorama`)  
- Saves the data in a uniquely named text file (`hello_<name>.txt`)  
- Reads the saved file back and prints it with borders  
- Logs the current timestamp

## Features
- Input handling with validation  
- String formatting using f-strings  
- File handling with `w+` mode and UTF-8 encoding  
- Colored terminal output using `colorama`  
- Auto timestamp logging  
- Conditional file saving based on user choice

## Requirements
